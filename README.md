# Nested-Sets-SQL-to-Tableau-Project
I worked with a client who had a nested sets database structure. I wanted to create a sunburst for one of their dashboards, but I needed the data to be in a very specific form for that. [Here's the custom SQL I wrote in Tableau to automate that from their database.](https://github.com/AnniesAnalytics/Nested-Sets-SQL-to-Tableau-Project/blob/main/Sunburst%20Full%20SQL%20Code)

Then, they wanted to [add a Sankey.](https://github.com/AnniesAnalytics/Nested-Sets-SQL-to-Tableau-Project/blob/main/Sankey%20Data%20Model%20SQL) So I made some more custom SQL for that!

I de-idenfitifed this by changing the names of things in the query to reflect a supermarket heirarchy, my original client was a different use case.
